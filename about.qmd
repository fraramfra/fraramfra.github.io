My name is Francisco Ramirez, but you can call me Paco.

I am a Mexican mechanical engineer with over 10 years of experience working in the aerospace industry, particularly in the thermodynamic design and prototype testing of aircraft engines.

I've been fortunate enough to have spend some time of my life living abroad, so I really like travelling and experiencing different cultures. My drive to learn new skill and doing so in a different country, led me to Canada.

In my spare time, I like to go on hikes, riding my longboard, playing drums, walking my dog (which I brough to Canada, in case anybody wants to meet him), and listening to music (albums, but mostly, live).

This is my 2nd week in MDS. Every day I like it more, and everyday I think it's less likely that I'll survive it.
